ğŸš€ Big O Notation like `Richter Scale` but numerical representation

ğŸš€ Big O Notation useful for;
    -How our code Performs?
    -Discussing Trade-offs between different approaches
    -Identify Inefficient Points

ğŸš€ What Does Better Mean In Code:
    - Faster (Through Timing Functions)
    - Less memory Intensive
    - More Readable

ğŸš€ The Problem with Timing Code :
    - Different Machines Will Record Different Times
    - The Same Machine Will record time different times
    - For fast algorithms, speed measurements may not be precise enough?
