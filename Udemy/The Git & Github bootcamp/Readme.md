ğŸ“Œ What is Git?

ğŸ“Œ Understanding the Difference between Git and Github

ğŸ“Œ History of Git ?

ğŸ“Œ Who Uses Git ?

ğŸ“Œ What does git do for us ?

ğŸ“Œ The Default Branch name is main instead of master

ğŸ“Œ Git is just a checkpoints

ğŸ“Œ Branches are just pointers to a specific commit

ğŸ“Œ branch early, and branch often

ğŸ“Œ git checkout -b [yourbranchname] create a new branch and check it out

ğŸ“Œ The first term of get or its initial name is "the stupid content tracker"

ğŸ“Œ GIT stands for Global Information Tracker

ğŸ“Œ Tech-Adjacent Roles uses Git as well as governments through that website you can find which gonverment uses git (https://government.github.com/community/)

ğŸ“Œ Git vs Github

ğŸ“Œ The Different ways of interacting with git CommandLine Interface and GUIs

ğŸ“Œ Installation Git

ğŸ“Œ Installing GitKraken

ğŸ“Œ Configuring your Git name and Email

ğŸ“Œ Terminal Crash course videos

ğŸ“Œ Graphical User Interface vs Command Line Interface

ğŸ“Œ The Rise of Git GUI's

ğŸ“Œ Most Macs come with git preinstalled

ğŸ“Œ git log (for checkpoints and their authors)

ğŸ“Œ git config --global user.email email@

ğŸ“Œ git config --global user.name "name"

ğŸ“Œ git config user.name

ğŸ“Œ git config user.email

ğŸ“Œ Installation gitkraken

ğŸ“Œ Basic Unix Commands

ğŸ“Œ touch app.js to create file called app.js in the current working directory

ğŸ“Œ rm app.js to remove file called app.js in the current working directory

ğŸ“Œ rm -f vs rm -d

ğŸ“Œ mkdir vs touch

ğŸ“Œ open . command to open finder where the same directory is working one

ğŸ“Œ file and folder creation, deletion and modifications instructions

ğŸ“Œ ls -a Unix Command to show hidden files

ğŸ“Œ rm -rf (rf stands for recursive, force)

ğŸ“Œ What are Git Repos?

ğŸ“Œ Git Init

ğŸ“Œ Git Status

ğŸ“Œ Understanding .git folder

ğŸ“Œ The Committing Workflow

ğŸ“Œ Git add

ğŸ“Œ Git commit

ğŸ“Œ Git log

ğŸ“Œ What is Git Repository?

ğŸ“Œ What is Git Init ?

ğŸ“Œ The mysterious git folder

ğŸ“Œ Git tracks everthing nested into folders

ğŸ“Œ DO NOT INIT A REPO INSIDE A REPO

ğŸ“Œ Working Directory vs Staging Area vs Repository Area (which is .git folder)

ğŸ“Œ if you type git commit It will prompts a text editor to type in

ğŸ“Œ git commit -m to pass an inline commit message rather than launching a text editor

ğŸ“Œ git log retrieves log of commits

ğŸ“Œ Commit hash overview

ğŸ“Œ Writing Atomic Commits

ğŸ“Œ Configuring Default Editor

ğŸ“Œ Working with a GUI

ğŸ“Œ Amending Commits

ğŸ“Œ Git Ignore

ğŸ“Œ Navigating the Git Documentation

ğŸ“Œ Writing Good Commit Messages

ğŸ“Œ One command can have many options

ğŸ“Œ Atomic means a basic and single unit | Irreducible, focuses only on a single thing
   
ğŸ“Œ Break up commits to achieve atomic commits concept

ğŸ“Œ The way writing comitting messages Present Tense
   and Imperative Style

ğŸ“Œ What is Vim ?

ğŸ“Œ Configuration Git's Default Editor

ğŸ“Œ We need commit hashes to undo a commit

ğŸ“Œ git log --abbrev-commit

ğŸ“Œ git log --oneline

ğŸ“Œ Committing with a GUI GITKARKEN Tool

ğŸ“Œ git commit --amend to redo the previous commit 
  1.Changes you forgot 2.Typo you've made in commit message

ğŸ“Œ There are files and directories to ignore in a given repository so we use .gitignore file for whatever you don't want to commit:

Secrets, API Keys, Credentials

Operating System Files (.DS_Store on Mac)

Log Files (Files are output your application automatically generated)

Dependencies and Packages

ğŸ“Œ Three Patterns to ignore files and folders:
.DS_Store (will ignore all the files names .DS_Store)

folderName/ (will ignore the entire directory)

*.log (will ignore any files with .log extension)

ğŸ“Œ gitignore.io

ğŸ“Œ Branching what is it? why use it?

ğŸ“Œ Understanding Git Head

ğŸ“Œ Git Branch

ğŸ“Œ Git Switch

ğŸ“Œ Git Checkout

ğŸ“Œ Git Deletion and Renaming Branches

ğŸ“Œ Heads and Refs behind the scenes

ğŸ“Œ Master vs Main Branch

ğŸ“Œ Each commit has Its own Hash and at least references one parent commit before it

ğŸ“Œ Branches enable us to create separate contexts where we can try new things or even work on multiple ideas

ğŸ“Œ Linear fashion vs non linear one

ğŸ“Œ you're always working on a branch which it is branch master

ğŸ“Œ Default branch name is master branch

ğŸ“Œ In 2020, "Github" renamed the default branch from master to main

ğŸ“Œ The default git branch is still master

ğŸ“Œ HEAD is a pointer to current location in repository it is usually a pointer to the branch reference 

ğŸ“Œ HEAD always points to latest commit you made on the master branch is SIMPLY A BRANCH POINTER

ğŸ“Œ Branch are bookmarks only one branch can be opened

ğŸ“Œ git branch to view current branch you're working on

ğŸ“Œ The active branch has asterisk next to it

ğŸ“Œ git branch <branchname> that create a branch (It does not switch HEAD) based upon the current HEAD

ğŸ“Œ git switch <branch-name>

ğŸ“Œ git commit -a -m <message> adding all unstaging changes

ğŸ“Œ git checkout <branch-name> switching branches as well as restore working tree files 

ğŸ“Œ git checkout <branch-name> vs git switch

ğŸ“Œ git switch -c <branch-name> with -c flag to create a new branch and switch to it

ğŸ“Œ git checkout -b <branch-name> with -b flag to create a new branch and switch to it

ğŸ“Œ While There is no application with a file there will be no conflicts

ğŸ“Œ git branch -d <branch-name> to delete a branch or that command
git branch --delete <branch-name>

ğŸ“Œ YOU CAN NOT DELETE A BRANCH THAT YOU'RE CURRENTLY IN

ğŸ“Œ git branch -D or 
   git branch --delete --force
   To DELETE THE BRANCH FORCEly

ğŸ“Œ To Rename a branch you've to be on the branch you wanna rename
git branch -m <new-branch-name>

ğŸ“Œ Head Reference a branch and each branch reference a commit

ğŸ“Œ Cat(concatenate) command is very frequently used in Linux. It reads data from the file and gives their content as output. It helps us to create, view, concatenate files. So let us see some frequently used cat commands. 

ğŸ“Œ Behind the scenes .git folder

ğŸ“Œ Fast Forward Merges

ğŸ“Œ Git Merge & Merge Commits

ğŸ“Œ Resolving Merge Conflicts

ğŸ“Œ Using VSCode to Resolve Conflicts

ğŸ“Œ Some people treat master branch the source of truth or the most stable build of an application

ğŸ“Œ Master Branch and Feature Branch

ğŸ“Œ - We merge branches, not specifc commits
   - We always merge to the current HEAD branch

ğŸ“Œ receiving branch

ğŸ“Œ git merge branch

ğŸ“Œ Fast-Forward Merge

ğŸ“Œ Not every merge is fast forward

ğŸ“Œ Commits can have multiple parents whenever we make a merged commit

ğŸ“Œ Merge Commit vs Fast Forward Merge

ğŸ“Œ Merge Conflicts is a multistep process Resolving Conflicts and commiting results

ğŸ“Œ Git changes the contents of your files to indicate conflicts that It wants you to resolve

ğŸ“Œ The content from branch you're going to merge is displayed between the

ğŸ“Œ Accept Incoming Change vs Current Change

ğŸ“Œ Reading Diffs

ğŸ“Œ Git Diff Basics

ğŸ“Œ Diffing Branches

ğŸ“Œ Diffing Commits

ğŸ“Œ Diffing Specific Files

ğŸ“Œ Git diff --staged

ğŸ“Œ We can use the git diff command to view changes between commits, branches, files, working directory and more

ğŸ“Œ we use git diff alongside commands like git status and git log

ğŸ“Œ git status, git diff and git log are informative commands

ğŸ“Œ Reconsolidation of git log --oneline

ğŸ“Œ git diff compares Staging Area and Working Directory

ğŸ“Œ git Explains Which file it is comparing. Usually There is two versions of the same file

ğŸ“Œ Git also declares one file as "A" and the other as "B"

ğŸ“Œ Next we have <File-Meta-Data>The first two numbers are the hashes of the two files and last nuber is an internal file mode identifier

ğŸ“Œ Markers

ğŸ“Œ Then We have chunks That are modified also Chunks don't contain only modified changes but also unchanged lines to provide some context

ğŸ“Œ Each Chunk Starts with a Chunk Header found between @@ and @@

ğŸ“Œ Then We've actual Changes

ğŸ“Œ Lines begin with - comes from file a

ğŸ“Œ Lines begin with + comes from file b

ğŸ“Œ Staging Area Also Refers to an Index

ğŸ“Œ git diff HEAD lists all changes in the working tree since your last commit
