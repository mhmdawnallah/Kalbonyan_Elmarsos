# Testing Program Javascript

ðŸ“Œ Goals of Testing:
    - Automate the process of   ensuring that our app works as we expect
    - Keep up form having to manually click around to find bugs
    -Make sure that app will still works as expected even after we change something

ðŸ“Œ Automating Testing vs Manual Testing

ðŸ“Œ Steve Thoughts about Testing:
    - People spend more time setting up testing than they do writing tests
    - All testing frameworks/libraries are essentially the same
    - You don't even have to use a testing library

ðŸ“Œ The underscore in the first letter of variable name is a completely valid identifier, is a completely valid variable name

ðŸ“Œ When you write some test related code we're always going to place it in a seperate file completely seperated from whatever code is

ðŸ“Œ <file-name-to-test>.test.js

ðŸ“Œ The Cons of `No-Frills Testing Implementation`:
    - Most Variables are declared in global scope of the program
    - If an error thrown the program CAN NOT CONTINUE EXECUTION
    - The ways of throwing error is not meaningful you must go through the entire program to ideentify where is the program throwing an error

ðŸ“Œ Assert Nodejs Standard Library <Ass>

ðŸ“Œ Assetion Testing -< Make Comparison

ðŸ“Œ assert.strictCall(`valuewegot`, `valueweexpect`, err-message)

ðŸ“Œ assert.deepStrictCall(`arraywegot`, `arrayweexpect`, err-message)

ðŸ“Œ Mocha is a feature-rich JavaScript test framework running on Node. js and in the browser, making asynchronous testing simple and fun.
