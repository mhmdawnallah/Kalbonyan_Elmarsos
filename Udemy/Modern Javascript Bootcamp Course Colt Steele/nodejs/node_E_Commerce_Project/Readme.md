### E-commerce App

ğŸ“Œ Request -> Node Js Server -> File-based data store

ğŸ“Œ File-based data store -> Nodejs Server -> HTML Doc

ğŸ“Œ Project Setup:
    1. Create a new Project Directory
    2. Generate a package.json file
    3. Install a few dependencies to help us write our project
    4. Create a 'start' script to run our project

ğŸ“Œ npm run <script>

ğŸ“Œ Express allow us to set up a full-featured web server that can receive network requests and respond to them (The same as Node Js Standard Library Server but there are more features and edge cases included)

ğŸ“Œ Route Handlers

ğŸ“Œ When we enter a url in a browser our browser formulating a network request Its components:
-`host`
-`Port`
-`Path`
-`Method`
    To Your Operating System then to Network devices e.g NIC
    , To DNS Server (Host Name, IP Address) If it is host
    , That means me (local computer) Ports on your computer 
        you can have many websevers 
    , Operating system runs website whatever its port is
    , Express Listens to that port and It cares about HTTP Request not all matter but `PATH`, `METHOD`
    , Router Object has multiple router handlers 
     
ğŸ“Œ Automatic Submission, Looking for Input Elements Into Form and collect all names values from form 

ğŸ“Œ When we make a form request method type with POST request it is appended into request body instead of url bar

ğŸ“Œ Buffer is an array of raw information in javascript

ğŸ“Œ You can get form data that is embededd into body Manually but It will be a repetitive task and don't achieve DRY Principle

ğŸ“Œ Middle Ware Function is a function that does some pre-processing on the `req` and `res` objects that is utimately usable through Express

ğŸ“Œ Express created before promises .

ğŸ“Œ next callback function means all the processing is done

ğŸ“Œ req object has access to method 

ğŸ“Œ Globally Applying Middlewares

ğŸ“Œ Express server interfaces with Data storage for storing users and products list by storing it on the hardware 
users.json
products.json

ğŸ“Œ - Will error if we try to ope/write the same file twitce at the same time
   - Won't work if we have multiple servers running on different machines
   - We have to write to the FS everytime we want to update some data

ğŸ“Œ In Server Design and data management There are two main approaches for managing data:
1.Repository Approach
    - A single class (repository) is responsible for data access
       All records are stored and used as a  plain JS object
2.Active Record Approach
    - Every Record is an instance of a model class that has its own methods to CRUD operations

ğŸ“Œ The PlainObject type is a JavaScript object containing zero or more key-value pairs. 

ğŸ“Œ Better Json Formatting using JSON.stringify(<records>, null, <indentation-levels>)

ğŸ“Œ toString('hex') In a String Hex Format

ğŸ“Œ SignUp Validation Logic 

ğŸ“Œ Cookies are very small string of characters That servers want the browser to store

ğŸ“Œ Request Cookies

ğŸ“Œ Cookies are in encrypted format

ğŸ“Œ Cookies Based Authentication

ğŸ“Œ Dealing With COOKIES using cookie-session npm library

ğŸ“Œ Signing out the user

ğŸ“Œ Password Hashing Algorithm

ğŸ“Œ It IS NEVER Now to take the output of Hashing Algorithm, injecting it through Hashing Algorithm, and give you the same input earlier

ğŸ“Œ Rainbow Table Attack

ğŸ“Œ Salt is a random string of characters that is going to prevent the user from giving us a password that is too common

ğŸ“Œ Salting + Hashing Passwords

ğŸ“Œ Project Structure will be divided into Routes, Repositories, and Views Directory

ğŸ“Œ Adding Better Form Validation

ğŸ“Œ An express.js middleware for validator.s

ğŸ“Œ Validation vs Sanitization

ğŸ“Œ Sanitization modifies each field in place applying each of sanitizers in the order they were specified

ğŸ“Œ Route Handler is a dedicated Javascript function to receive incoming requests

ğŸ“Œ Exposing Public Directories


ğŸ“Œ There is a default value method in form which is `GET` taking all the information  of form and added to url and send url to backend

ğŸ“Œ method define how it is gonna be transmitted but `enctype` encoding type how form data is gonna be encoded

ğŸ“Œ the default value for enctype is
`application/x-www-form-urlencoded`

ğŸ“Œ Form Data Multipart Submission

ğŸ“Œ Multipart Request each part represents a different input out of the form

ğŸ“Œ Load Balancer receives incoming requests and divide them on one instance of server instances

ğŸ“Œ Different Methods of Image Storage:
ğŸš€ Co-Located Hard Disk 
ğŸš€ Database (The cost)
ğŸš€ Stream Through to Centralized Datastore from cloud provider
ğŸš€ Presigned URL 
    - The best
    - Browser makes an initial request to Servers but severs don't take the responsibility of uploading images to data store but it retures presigned Url to the browser. It has some configurations and temporary access to the browser to upload the image itself to Data store of any cloud provider you've assigned to the project before
    -Secure, Cost-Effective

ğŸ“Œ A presigned URL is a URL that you can provide to your users to grant temporary access to a specific S3 object

ğŸ“Œ Express is already written before promises and async/await
