ğŸ“Œ Request -> Node Js Server -> File-based data store

ğŸ“Œ File-based data store -> Nodejs Server -> HTML Doc

ğŸ“Œ Project Setup:
    1. Create a new Project Directory
    2. Generate a package.json file
    3. Install a few dependencies to help us write our project
    4. Create a 'start' script to run our project

ğŸ“Œ npm run <script>

ğŸ“Œ Express allow us to set up a full-featured web server that can receive network requests and respond to them (The same as Node Js Standard Library Server but there are more features and edge cases included)

ğŸ“Œ Route Handlers

ğŸ“Œ When we enter a url in a browser our browser formulating a network request Its components:
-`host`
-`Port`
-`Path`
-`Method`
    To Your Operating System then to Network devices e.g NIC
    , To DNS Server (Host Name, IP Address) If it is host
    , That means me (local computer) Ports on your computer 
        you can have many websevers 
    , Operating system runs website whatever its port is
    , Express Listens to that port and It cares about HTTP Request not all matter but `PATH`, `METHOD`
    , Router Object has multiple router handlers 
     
ğŸ“Œ Automatic Submission, Looking for Input Elements Into Form and collect all names values from form 

ğŸ“Œ When we make a form request method type with POST request it is appended into request body instead of url bar

ğŸ“Œ Buffer is an array of raw information in javascript

ğŸ“Œ You can get form data that is embededd into body Manually but It will be a repetitive task and don't achieve DRY Principle

ğŸ“Œ Middle Ware Function is a function that does some pre-processing on the `req` and `res` objects that is utimately usable through Express

ğŸ“Œ Express created before promises .

ğŸ“Œ next callback function means all the processing is done

ğŸ“Œ req object has access to method
