### Course details

<<<<<<< HEAD
- Design patterns are reusable solutions that solve the challenges software developers face over and over again. Rather than reinventing the wheel, learn how to make use of these proven and tested patterns that will make your software more flexible and resilient to change. This course introduces you to design patterns and takes you through several of the most used object-oriented patterns. Elisabeth Robson and Eric Freeman, coauthors of Head First Design Patterns, join forces to provide an overview of each pattern and examples of the pattern in action. Featured design patterns include the Strategy, Adapter, Observer, and Decorator patterns. Elisabeth and Eric lend these concepts a real-world context by providing code demos in Java, with the occasional example in Python and JavaScript.

### Learning objectives
- What are design patterns?
- Encapsulating code that varies with the Strategy pattern
- The limitations of inheritance
- Using the Adapter pattern
- Implementing the Observer pattern
- Extending behavior with composition and the Decorator pattern
- Encapsulating iteration with the Iterator pattern
- Object creation with the Factory Method pattern
- Using design principles to guide your object-oriented design

=======
-  Gain the core knowledge to begin programming in any language. In this course, instructor Annyce Davis uses Python to explore the core concepts and structure of programming languages and helps you grasp what’s going on under the hood. After going over basic statements and expressions in Python, Annyce explores strings, variables, and conditional code which are common topics in all programming languages. She also shows how to work with different kinds of data and troubleshoot a variety of errors. Along the way, she compares how code is written in several different languages and provides guidance on the criteria to use when choosing a programming language. Upon wrapping up this course, you’ll have the knowledge you need to continue your coding journey in whichever language piques your interest.
